                             3-{npm i nodemon}------>install nodemon ---->its help in making no run code every time

=> make a {index.js} file

==> for setup backend we add code in index.js

        const express = require('express')
        const app = express();
        app.get("/",(req,resp)=>{
            resp.send("app is working")
            })
            app.listen(5000)  

 ===> after that we simply run nodemon in terminal to check whether it is working or noot in browser
 =====>for that we go to browser and in adress bar type localhost:5000(or dedicated port) andd see output.

===>Frontend
